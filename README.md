# **Swarnima Raj Mohan Bisht**  
### **B.Tech Computer Science | DevOps Enthusiast | Cloud & Automation**  
🚀 Passionate about Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Infrastructure Automation  

## 🌟 **About Me**  
Hi! I’m **Swarnima Raj Mohan Bisht**, a **B.Tech Computer Science** student specializing in **DevOps** at **UPES, Dehradun**. I am deeply interested in **Cloud Computing, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Containerization**.  

I have hands-on experience with **AWS, Docker, Terraform, Prometheus, and Grafana** and have deployed scalable applications on the cloud. 

🔹 **How It All Started:**  
It all began when my professor asked us to read about Netflix's cloud migration. As I dug deeper, I was fascinated by how they scaled so quickly, maintained high availability, and built a system that could withstand failures effortlessly.

Learning about Netflix’s Simian Army—a suite of tools designed to intentionally break their own system to make it more resilient—was a game-changer for me. The idea that failures could be embraced, tested, and even automated to build stronger, more fault-tolerant systems completely changed how I saw technology.

That was my turning point. I wanted to not just build applications but design infrastructure that is scalable, resilient, and self-healing. That’s what led me to DevOps and Cloud, and I haven’t looked back since! 🚀
